# Mortgage Calculator

A simple mortgage calculator jupyter notebook that takes in details about the property, deposit and interest rate, and returns the monthly repayments and total repayments. It creates a simple GUI using ipywidgets, renders an amortisation table using pandas, and plots on a line graph the interest vs. principal in the monthly payments through the length of the mortgage using matplotlib.
